//The Generic layer is the first one that actually produces any CSS.
//It houses very high-level, far reaching styles. This layer is seldom modified,
//and is usually the same across any projects you work on.
//It contains things like Normalize.css, global box-sizing rules, CSS resets and so on.
//The Generic layer affects a lot of the DOM, hence it being nice and wide in the Triangle model,
//and occurring very early on.
